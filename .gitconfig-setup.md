# Git Auto-Push Setup

## ✅ Already Configured

I've set up automatic pushing to GitHub for you! Here's what's been configured:

### 1. Post-Commit Hook
A git hook has been created that automatically pushes to GitHub after every commit you make manually.

**Location:** `.git/hooks/post-commit`

### 2. Auto-Push Script
A script is available to quickly commit and push all changes.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run push
# or
npm run auto-push
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Push (After Manual Commits)
When you run:
```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```

It will automatically push to GitHub after the commit completes.

### Quick Push Script
When you run:
```bash
npm run push
```

It will:
1. Stage all changes (`git add -A`)
2. Commit with timestamp (`git commit`)
3. Push to GitHub (`git push origin main`)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Authentication:** The auto-push will use your configured git credentials. If you haven't set up authentication, you may need to:
   - Use a Personal Access Token
   - Set up SSH keys
   - Configure git credentials

2. **Branch:** Currently set to push to `main` branch. If you use a different branch, update the scripts.

3. **Manual Control:** You can still commit without pushing by using:
   ```bash
   git commit --no-verify -m "message"
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Auto-commit and push everything
npm run push

# Just push (after you've committed)
git push

# Commit and auto-push
git commit -m "message"  # Will auto-push after commit
```

## 🔒 Security Note

The git hook is local to your machine and won't be pushed to GitHub (it's in `.git/hooks/` which is excluded from the repository).
