# Git Auto-Push Setup

## ✅ Already Configured

I've set up automatic pushing to GitHub for you! Here's what's been configured:

**Note:** For automatic pushing to work, you need to set up authentication first. See "Authentication Setup" below.

### 1. Post-Commit Hook
A git hook has been created that automatically pushes to GitHub after every commit you make manually.

**Location:** `.git/hooks/post-commit`

### 2. Auto-Push Script
A script is available to quickly commit and push all changes.

**Usage:**
```bash
npm run push
# or
npm run auto-push
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### Automatic Push (After Manual Commits)
When you run:
```bash
git commit -m "Your message"
```

It will automatically push to GitHub after the commit completes.

### Quick Push Script
When you run:
```bash
npm run push
```

It will:
1. Stage all changes (`git add -A`)
2. Commit with timestamp (`git commit`)
3. Push to GitHub (`git push origin main`)

## 🔐 Authentication Setup (Required for Auto-Push)

For automatic pushing to work, you need to set up authentication. Choose one method:

### Method 1: Quick Setup Script (Recommended)
```bash
./setup-git-auth.sh
```

This script will guide you through setting up authentication.

### Method 2: Manual Credential Storage
```bash
git config credential.helper store
git push origin main
# Enter your GitHub username and Personal Access Token when prompted
# Credentials will be saved for future pushes
```

### Method 3: Token in Remote URL
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/j1kn/crypto-raffle.git
```

Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your GitHub Personal Access Token.

### Method 4: SSH Keys (Most Secure)
```bash
# Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copy and add to GitHub Settings > SSH and GPG keys

# Change remote to SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:j1kn/crypto-raffle.git
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Authentication:** The auto-push will use your configured git credentials. If you haven't set up authentication, you may need to:
   - Use a Personal Access Token
   - Set up SSH keys
   - Configure git credentials

2. **Branch:** Currently set to push to `main` branch. If you use a different branch, update the scripts.

3. **Manual Control:** You can still commit without pushing by using:
   ```bash
   git commit --no-verify -m "message"
   ```

## 🚀 Quick Commands

```bash
# Auto-commit and push everything
npm run push

# Just push (after you've committed)
git push

# Commit and auto-push
git commit -m "message"  # Will auto-push after commit
```

## 🔒 Security Note

The git hook is local to your machine and won't be pushed to GitHub (it's in `.git/hooks/` which is excluded from the repository).
