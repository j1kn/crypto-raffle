## 🔒 PIN Security Tips

1. **Use a strong PIN:**
   - At least 8 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, and symbols
   - Don't use common words or dates

2. **Keep it secret:**
   - Never share your PIN
   - Don't commit it to Git
   - Store it securely (password manager)

3. **Change it regularly:**
   - Update `ADMIN_PIN` in Vercel
   - Redeploy after changing

## 🛡️ How It Works

1. **Login:** User visits `/superman` and enters PIN
2. **Verification:** PIN is checked against `ADMIN_PIN` environment variable
3. **Session:** On success, session is stored in browser localStorage
4. **Access:** User can access all admin routes while session is active
5. **Logout:** Click logout button to clear session

## 📍 Admin Routes

- **Login:** `/superman`
- **Dashboard:** `/superman/dashboard`
- **Create Raffle:** `/superman/raffles/new`
- **Edit Raffle:** `/superman/raffles/[id]/edit`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid PIN" Error
- Check `ADMIN_PIN` is set in Vercel environment variables
- Verify PIN matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Redeploy after setting/updating PIN

### Can't Access Admin Panel
- Make sure you're visiting `/superman` (not `/admin`)
- Clear browser cache and localStorage
- Try again with correct PIN

### Session Expired
- Click logout and login again
- Clear browser localStorage if needed

## 🔄 Migration from Wallet-Based Admin

**Old System:** `/admin` (wallet-based)
**New System:** `/superman` (PIN-based)

The old `/admin` route still exists but you should use `/superman` for better security.
